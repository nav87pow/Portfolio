# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, created as a beginner front-end developer.  
The site is built to present my skills, work experience, and projects in a clean and responsive design.

## Structure
- **Home Page**: Contains an introduction about myself, my work experience, and a section showcasing the front-end projects I have worked on.
- **Project Page**: Displays detailed information about each project.

## Current Status
The project is currently built as an HTML & CSS template, optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Next Steps
- Integrate project data using **JSON**.
- Implement dynamic functionality with **JavaScript**.
